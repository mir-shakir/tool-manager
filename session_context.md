# ToolShelf MVP Development Context

## Project Overview
This session focused on initializing and setting up the frontend for the **ToolShelf MVP**, a web application for teams to manage and share a curated list of developer tools. The primary source of requirements and the project plan is the `Content.txt` file in the root directory.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Backend & Auth:** Supabase (using `@supabase/ssr` for server-side rendering and middleware)

## Current Progress (Sprint 1 Completion)
The initial project setup as defined in "Sprint 1" of `Content.txt` is complete.

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    - A Next.js project was created in the `/toolshelf-app` directory.
    - The project is configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.

2.  **UI Library Setup:**
    - `shadcn/ui` has been initialized and configured.
    - Core dependencies like `tailwindcss-animate`, `clsx`, and `tailwind-merge` are installed.
    - The necessary configuration files (`components.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`) and CSS globals have been created and set up.
    - The `Button`, `Card`, and `Input` components have been added to the project.

3.  **Folder Structure:**
    - The directory structure specified in the project plan has been created inside `toolshelf-app/src`, including:
      - `components/ui` & `components/common`
      - `lib`
      - `hooks`
      - `types`
      - `services`

4.  **Supabase Integration:**
    - The Supabase client has been set up using the `@supabase/ssr` package.
    - A configuration file is located at `toolshelf-app/src/lib/supabase.ts`.
    - A `.env.local` file has been created with placeholder credentials for Supabase.

5.  **Authentication Flow:**
    - **Pages:** Signup and Login pages have been created at `toolshelf-app/src/app/(auth)/`. They include basic forms that interact with Supabase Auth.
    - **Protected Routes:** Middleware has been implemented in `toolshelf-app/src/middleware.ts` to protect application routes.
      - Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.
      - Authenticated users attempting to access `/login` or `/signup` are redirected to the dashboard root.

6.  **Dashboard Layout:**
    - A basic dashboard layout has been created at `toolshelf-app/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`.
    - A placeholder dashboard home page exists at `toolshelf-app/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`.

## Next Steps (Start of Sprint 2)
The next session should begin with "Sprint 2: Core Team & Tool Management" from `Content.txt`. The immediate tasks are:
1.  **Team Creation & Membership:**
    - Build the UI for users to create a new team.
    - Implement the UI for team admins to view and manage team members.
2.  **Master Tool Catalog:**
    - Create a page to display the list of tools from the `master_tools` table.
    - Implement search and filter functionality for the catalog.
3.  **Team Shelf Functionality:**
    - Build the UI to display tools that have been added to a team's specific "shelf".
